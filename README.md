## 📈 Revenue Estimation Algorithm

Our revenue estimation system uses multiple factors:

1. **Base Industry Multipliers**: Industry-specific revenue benchmarks
2. **State Business-Friendliness**: Tax rate and regulatory environment
3. **Budget Level**: Investment capacity adjustments
4. **Experience Level**: Expertise-based multipliers
5. **Time Commitment**: Availability-based scaling

### Example Calculation
```
Base Revenue × State Multiplier × Budget Multiplier × Experience Multiplier = Final Revenue
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Industries
1. Update `src/data/industries.ts` with new industry data
2. Add industry-specific business ideas in `src/services/aiGenerator.ts`
3. Update revenue multipliers in the calculation function

### Adding New States
1. Update `src/data/states.ts` with state information
2. Include tax rates and business-friendliness ratings
3. Add state-specific descriptions

### Modifying Revenue Algorithms
1. Edit the `calculateRevenueEstimates` function in `src/services/aiGenerator.ts`
2. Adjust multipliers and factors as needed
3. Test with different user preferences

## 🌍 Infrastructure Architecture

### AWS Production Environment
